# nwn-boilerplate-prc
This repository contains a very basic NWN module with PRC installed, using the framework from the boilerplate repository [nwn-devbase](https://github.com/jakkn/nwn-devbase/). It is intended for people looking for an example online server running PRC. The database is MySQL but can easily be switched with any of the other options, except BiowareDB.
